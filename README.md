# ColorCraft

Color pallet creator for generating HSL pallets for web and etc.
Every other of the million pallet creators aren't great to use so I made my own.

todo:

- import/export to json
- sanitize input values in color forms
- make color group name an input
- fix flex-wrap on color groups
- up/down arrow to change color values
